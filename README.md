# stockfinder
Simple web app created with JQuery and JS to easily find and favorite your stocks (uses Barchart api)

The app uses ECMA6 classes that act as components in other framworks that implement ECMA. You should be able to convert to a framework 
like Ember or Anguar without too much hassle.  

The api server is a Node server in the api folder. This server can be swapped out with other implementations (i.e. .NET API etc.). The app  should run on any web server.  

Only tested with Chrome
